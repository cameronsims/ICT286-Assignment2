			Click on the "catalog" menu option, there you will be given two ways to search the 
			Database for items. Searching by category or searching by keywords, both can be used
			seperately or together. Searching with "None" as a category will return all items.
			If no items have been queried the catalog entries will be empty, and no items will be visible until returned.
